# DMV Agent: Because Sunburns and Bureaucracy Shouldn't Mix

## Why Did I Build This?

Okay, real talk. One time, I spent FIVE HOURS standing outside the DMV, sweating under the sun, just to be allowed inside. I thought, "Finally, I'm in!" But nope. A very "nice" lady (bless her heart) checked my stack of documents with the speed and enthusiasm of a sloth on a coffee break. She handed me a ticket—so I could wait ANOTHER five hours. I wish I was exaggerating.

Somewhere between hour seven and my third existential crisis, I thought: "There has to be a better way." So, instead of just complaining to my friends (again), I built this DMV Agent. If you've ever felt your soul leave your body in a government waiting room, this one's for you.

## Why Use This Agent Instead of a Human?

- Will never be rude to you (no sighs, no eye rolls, no "take a number and wait")
- Never takes a break, never goes on lunch, never mysteriously disappears for 45 minutes
- Costs a LOT less than minimum wage—seriously, running on OpenAI's GPT-4o model is just a few cents per session (check OpenAI's pricing for the latest, but it's probably less than your coffee)
- Won't judge your paperwork, your photo, or your questionable life choices
- Available 24/7, even on weekends and holidays (try getting that at the DMV)
- Actually wants to help you (because, well, that's literally all it does)


## Getting Started

You don't need sunscreen or a folding chair for this. Just run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy the sweet, sweet feeling of not being in line.

## What Does This Actually Do?

- Helps you figure out what you need for your DMV adventure (without the sunburn)
- Checks if you have all the right docs, so you don't get that "missing form" surprise
- Remembers your intent, so you don't forget why you started this journey in the first place
- Responds with the patience of someone who hasn't been waiting since sunrise

## Want to Help?

Pull requests are welcome! If you add a DMV horror story to your PR, I promise to read it and probably laugh (or cry) in solidarity.
